                                     - - Whity the chase PLUS part 2 - -

so, in the 1st Song, a cutscene will appear
where it skips from Daddy dearest week Till end of yanders Attack
where Pico appears
in the 1st Song, Bf Fights against Pico,
in the end of the Song, Whitty appears
in the 2nd Song, both Sing and try to corrupt Bf and GF,
in the middle of the Song, GF joins bf
in the end, Whitty screams with much Power and uncorrupts Pico and himself a Lil bit
but BFS Hand corrupts
in the 3rd Song, Whitty has gone Ballistic and Then then corrupted citizens come

"Like in the part 2
Will whitty have a OP explosion that it will kill the corrupted citizens
Like renx whitty part 1"
hmm, that Led me Into an idea

"Then in the future
As an part 3
Like renx remastered week u know the detonation
Song
Like he cant explode to uncorrupt himself
Or smth like that
Is what i mean"

He wont, Bf and GF do

in the 3rd Song it will BE kinda like estranged, but i'll think of i should add Soul or not

"Yea
U should
More content"

OK, ok

the 4th Song, it will BE kinda shorter than Song 2 and 3 bc its kinda predictable,

yeah,there whitty gets fully uncorrupts in the middle of the song
but Pico is 1/3 corrupted so the 3 save them
(Bf, GF and Whitty)

"Will there be a part where whitty will try to uncorrupt carol(or bf and gf help him)?"

Carol would BE in the crowd

in the end of Song 4, the citizens get fully uncorrupted

"This is the good ending or true ending?"

according to the original Au, there will BE 4 victims (NOT CANON TO MOD LOL)

Canon ending = Whitty explodes but the crowd is corrupted 
true ending, Whitty stays

"Whitty stays uncorrupted?"

yes

So witty wins against the corruption

yes
you know how Part 2 would USUALLY BE like?
nothing special
just Whitty corrupting ruv 
luckily, i scrapped the idea
